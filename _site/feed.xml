&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first post of this blog! I originally wrote this two years ago, partway through my first year of grad school, intending to kick off an in-realtime blog about getting better with OCD. I had just been diagnosed with it 6 months earlier after struggling with it for my entire life. At that time it was severe, and I was upset about it. I figured if nothing else, I could channel that upset into sharing a story someone else could relate to - the story I wish I could have read when I was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the post in one sitting, saved it as “1.odt” because I couldn’t think of a good name for it, and then completely chickened out on the blog idea and didn’t look at it again for another year and a half. Since then, I’ve attempted to get this blog going easily 3 or 4 times over the year+, each time letting technical issues completely stop me dead in my tracks for several months. Now, finally, I have something going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To any friends and family who are reading this, thanks for your endless encouragement in me getting this up. To anyone else reading this, whether you have or know someone with OCD, hopefully it gives one more small insight into the ever-shifting facets of this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reading-a-paper-with-ocd---2021&quot;&gt;Reading a Paper with OCD - 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is (or rather, will hopefully be) a monthly blog about a single person’s experiences trying to start graduate school with OCD.
I’m mostly writing it for myself, but will post online to hold myself to a schedule, and because if even one person reads this and finds it interesting or cathartic (the way I did when I first read accounts of others’ OCD), then that’s a small amount of good this one blog will have accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I have no advice to give - I write this just to give a perspective, and to keep some kind of marker of the journey I’m undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, I am a first year Computer Science PhD student who was diagnosed with ADHD-PI halfway through my undergrad, and then with OCD in my first semester of grad school/only a few months ago. I’ve had these disorders my entire life, but never had their names until adulthood. By the start of grad school, my OCD had begun to affect my work so much that all of my usual ADHD coping techniques were failing entirely, and I would regularly spend 6+ hours in one sitting trying to complete work that should have only taken an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what it has been like, trying to peer into the fields I want to explore:
I pull up endless papers on Google or in conference proceedings, all of them interesting, on topics like obfuscation, security analysis, assembly, reverse engineering, IoT, embedded systems security…
The sheer number of options is overwhelming. I feel if I choose the wrong one then I will cripple my academic career entirely, even though I know this is not true.
If I can manage to choose one, I immediately face a dozen choices, all of which seem equally daunting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The introduction has a number of CS and stats terms terms that all seem important to understand (or suggest another entire field to explore). Do I look at the Wikipedia pages for them first, to better understand the premise of the paper? If I do this, then…
  	- The Wikipedia page has even more background terms to support the topic I chose to brush up on. Do I look at these as well? Repeat to infinity…
  	- How long do I spend reading each subtopic? What if I miss something important by cutting my reading too short? What if I forget what I was reading in the first place, or why I came to this particular page first?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I manage to move on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The methodology is always a minefield. Although I know I can’t be expected to fully understand all of it as a beginner, my OCD tells me I’ve wasted all of my time reading the paper so far if I don’t understand the methods and every single one of their details. So I reread, and reread, and reread again. Sometimes I enjoy this rereading – repetition is comforting, and, like learning an instrument, helps me gain familiarity with the concepts. But when my OCD is bad I feel I can’t stop doing it, even when it brings no benefit, and it is deeply stressful(&lt;em&gt;“Did I really understand that sentence correctly? Maybe I should read it 3 more times to be sure… But now it sounds different, so I’ll read it again…“&lt;/em&gt;). And then there’s the problem of:
  	* How much time do I spend searching about all the concepts used in the method so I can fully understand it, like…
      	- statistical methods
      	- set theory
      	- Calculus?
      	- &lt;em&gt;Hell, should I find the authors’ source code so I can REALLY understand it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the ever-nagging question: &lt;em&gt;What if I think I understand things, but I don’t really? (Should I read the paper from the beginning again?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I reach the evaluation, if I even get that far, I’m exhausted. I can’t complete a paragraph of it without going back to reread something from the methodology, just one more time.
This process spans days or weeks. The anxiety over my performance and understanding of the material builds to the point where, even when I put down a paper for a week, and then return to it, I feel the same frustration and desperation I had when I first read it. So I can burn myself out on any paper in no time. As crazy as it is, getting this far is on a good day - most days, the pressure I feel around trying to pick up a paper is so severe that I just won’t do it. I have a backlog of papers I want to read, but picking one up is about as appealing as picking up some hot coals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have similar problems with homework, and, whenever I get there, will have them for my research work.
I have contemplated sharing my diagnosis with my professors, to give some insight into why I struggle so much on simple (although, even they say these are not simple) tasks. But they are academics, not therapists, and can’t help with a disorder like this. Ultimately only I can take the steps to get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do to get better? In my case, I am working on this with a therapist who has been terrific and has experience working with OCD. In our last session, she had me face the fears driving me to decision paralysis with homework: the fear of failing grad school, of disappointing my professors, of completely bombing out of this trajectory I have so much hope for and finding myself having made no more progress in life than when I first graduated from college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had me say out loud, “I might not get A’s. I might fail. I might never correctly understand research papers. I don’t know the right way to do everything. I might not ever. I might get things horribly wrong. Maybe I will misunderstand if I don’t reread things…”, and, in finally facing my fears head-on, I had a panic attack so severe I dry heaved. And after the panic had passed, that night, it was a little easier to pick up a paper again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel it adds some context to the disorder to mention that I broke into tears twice while writing this blog. None of the things described here are really so terrible as to warrant crying, but that’s why it’s a disorder, isn’t it? Behind every question and symptom I’ve mentioned in this post lies countless hours of stress and shame and feeling like I’m absolutely crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that brings me to mentioning one of my now favorite quotes, just discovered this week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s the difference between a crazy person and, someone with OCD?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person with OCD knows they’re crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the premise of this blog – to explore and lay out all the usual stresses of grad school but with an OCD(and in later posts, ADHD) flair, and all the while acknowledging how utterly nuts it is. By the time I write the next post, maybe I won’t even have OCD symptoms around reading papers or trying to get homework done; or maybe they’ll still be there, but more manageable. Or maybe they will be even worse, and I’ll post this after dropping out of grad school as a “warning signs you need more help” kind of deal. I have no idea. For once, I am healthy enough now to say, “I don’t know”, and accept it for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="gradschoolexp" /><category term="ocd" /><summary type="html">Reading a Paper with OCD Welcome to the first post of this blog!
