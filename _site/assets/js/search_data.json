The `children` property must then contain a list of document `id`s to be included in that section. #### Example ```yaml sidebar: - label: Section One children: - document-one - document-two - document-three ``` ### Mixed Sidebar Types You can mix both root level links and collapsible items in a sidebar. #### Example ```yaml sidebar: - getting-started - label: Dev Docs children: - doc-1 - doc-2 - deployment ``` ### Label Customization By default, the `title` of a page will be used as the label in the sidebar. If you do not specify a `title` in your documents [front matter](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#front-matter) then the first heading in the document will be extracted using the [`jekyll-titles-from-headings`](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-titles-from-headings) plugin (which GitHub automatically includes). If you want to customize the sidebar label further, you can do so by setting a `sidebar_label` attribute in the [front matter](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#front-matter). ``` --- id: my-document title: This is a really long title that is bad for a sidebar sidebar_label: Long Title --- ## Some header that is also a bad sidebar title ``` ",
